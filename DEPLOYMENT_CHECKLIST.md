# ðŸš€ Smart Automated Scraper Deployment Checklist

## Step 1: Deploy the Function
```bash
# Commit and push the new smart scraper
git add .
git commit -m "Add smart automated scraper with FLEX-based change detection"
git push
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to **Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables**

### Add these variables:

#### Monitor Configuration:
```
MONITOR_URL = https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/article/2025-fantasy-football-rankings-justin-boones-top-quarterbacks-for-week-1-174915206.html
LAST_STORED_TIMESTAMP = 2025-09-07T16:02:06.000Z
```

#### Datawrapper URLs (use your current ones):
```
QB_URLS = https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bqgx9/
RB_URLS = https://www.datawrapper.de/_/hPdJB/
WR_URLS = https://www.datawrapper.de/_/LBvt2/
TE_URLS = https://www.datawrapper.de/_/fDdoY/
FLEX_URLS = https://www.datawrapper.de/_/FpqPP
DEF_URLS = https://www.datawrapper.de/_/V27sf
K_URLS = https://www.datawrapper.de/_/t1sdx
```

## Step 3: Test the Function

After deployment, test manually:

### Test URL:
```
https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/smart-automated-scraper
```

### Expected Response (if no changes):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "updateNeeded": false,
  "message": "FLEX data unchanged - timestamp change was false alarm",
  "note": "Consider updating LAST_STORED_TIMESTAMP to: ..."
}
```

### Expected Response (if changes detected):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "updateNeeded": true,
  "totalPlayers": 245,
  "message": "Rankings successfully updated with new data!",
  "manualStep": "Update LAST_STORED_TIMESTAMP to: ..."
}
```

## Step 4: Monitor Function Logs

1. Go to **Netlify Dashboard â†’ Functions**
2. Click **smart-automated-scraper**
3. View logs to ensure it's working

## Step 5: Verify Automatic Scheduling

The function will now run **automatically every hour from 6 AM - 6 PM ET**.

Check logs periodically to ensure it's running successfully.

## ðŸŽ¯ Your New Workflow

### Weekly Setup (5 minutes):
1. **Update environment variables** in Netlify:
   - New `MONITOR_URL` 
   - New Datawrapper URLs for all positions
2. **Done!** System runs automatically

### When Function Finds Changes:
1. **Function scrapes and updates rankings.json automatically**
2. **You get notification with new timestamp**
3. **Update `LAST_STORED_TIMESTAMP`** environment variable (30 seconds)

### If You Forget to Update Timestamp:
- âœ… **No problem!** FLEX check prevents unnecessary work
- âœ… **System continues working efficiently**
- âœ… **No errors or duplicate data**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Function Not Running:
- Check Netlify Functions tab for errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check function logs

### No Data Scraped:
- Test individual Datawrapper URLs manually
- Check if URLs are still valid
- Verify FLEX_URLS is set correctly

### Function Times Out:
- Netlify functions have 10-second limit for scheduled functions
- If scraping takes too long, we may need optimization

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

âœ… Function appears in Netlify Functions dashboard  
âœ… Function runs hourly (check logs)  
âœ… FLEX change detection works (prevents unnecessary scraping)  
âœ… Rankings.json gets updated when real changes occur  
âœ… You only need to update timestamp when changes happen  

## ðŸ“± Monitoring

### Daily:
- Check if rankings.json was updated (if Boone posted new rankings)

### Weekly:
- Update environment variables with new URLs
- Update timestamp if function found changes

### Monthly:
- Review function logs for any issues
- Verify everything is working smoothly

**Your rankings will now update automatically in the cloud!** ðŸŽ‰
